Exposure
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this section, the exposure calculation will take place. Here in the EAR layer you will see all the layers you have added previously in Elements at risk section. Similarly, 
in the hazard layer you will find the layers you have added previously in the hazard tab. If you haven’t done so, please do it through the :ref:`Data Management<datamgmt>` section. In order to calculate 
the exposure, you need to select the combination of EAR layer and the hazard layer. You can make multiple selection and all the combinations will be listed down below. Here, you can 
also find a section where you can select on what level of administrative unit you want to aggregate the exposure calculation. All the admin layer you have previously added will appear
here. If you haven’t done so already please do it through the :ref:`Administrative<admin>` tab under the :ref:`Data Management<datamgmt>` section. If you do not wish to aggregate the exposure calculation and do 
it in the level of EAR layer then simply leave these check box empty. Once you have your desired information, click on calculate exposure button on the bottom right. When the calculation 
has been completed, click on ‘view already completed exposure layers’. Here you can visualize the calculated exposure |viewdata| and also download it in a tabular format |downloaddata|.

Loss
^^^^^^^^
In this section you will able to calculate total loss based on the previously calculated exposure. Before proceeding make sure you have already computed the exposure under the :ref:`Modelling<model>` section. 
Here under the loss type you need to define the on what EAR type you want the calculation. The column connection for values and population needs to be defined previously in the EAR section.
If you haven’t done so, please do it under the :ref:`Data Management<datamgmt>` section. Then make selection of the type of computation you want perform. Then on the bottom you will see the list of all the exposures 
that have been previous computed. Make a selection from the list and then click on *Calculate loss*. 
When the calculation has been completed, click on *View already computed losses*. Here you can visualize the calculated loss |viewdata1| and also download it in a tabular format |downloaddata1|.

Risk
^^^^^^^^^
In this section you will able to calculate risk based on the previously calculated loss. Before proceeding make sure you have already computed the loss under the :ref:`Modelling<model>` section. By default, 
the *New risk computation* tab has two steps: *Computation type* and *Loss selection*. Here under the *Computation type* you need to define which type of computation you want either single hazard or multi-hazard computation. 
When you choose single hazard, then EAR type and hazard type need to be selected. You can also aggregate as per the administrative unit depending upon your calculation. After clicking continue at the bottom, you will be directed 
to *Loss Selection*. Here, you have to choose the already computed loss combination layers for a particular hazard type with different return periods. For example: Building loss layers with 20 year flood, 50 year flood and 100 year 
flood. After clicking the submit button, you can check the risk results in the *View already computed risks* tab. Here you can visualize |viewdata2| the calculated Average Annual Loss (AAL) and also download it in a tabular format |downloaddata2|.

When you choose multi-hazard in the *Computation type* under *New risk computation** tab, three extra steps will be shown in addition to *Computation type*
and *Loss selection* on the bottom you will see the list of all the exposures 
that have been previous computed. Make a selection from the list and then click on *Calculate loss*. 
When the calculation has been completed, click on *View already computed losses*. Here you can visualize the calculated loss and also download it in a tabular format .
